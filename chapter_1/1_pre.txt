The Oscar-nominated actor will play the young Albus in the sequel to Harry1 Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.
Law's casting sees him follow in the footsteps of Richard Harris and Sir Michael Gambon, who shared the role of Harry's headmaster in the Potter films.
The new film, due out in November 2018, will depict2 the character before he became head of Hogwarts.
Directed by David Yates, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 2 will see Eddie Redmayne reprise his role as "magizoologist" Newt Scamander.
"Jude Law is a phenomenally talented actor whose work I've long admired and I'm looking forward to finally having the opportunity to work with him," said Yates in a statement.
